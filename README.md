These are the basic requirement to run the Beat program.

1. The user needs to have the source files in a directory named Beat
2. The user needs to download and install Processing (tested version: 2.2.1)
3. The user needs to use a midi file in order to generate the beat map and play the audio. There are many free midi files available on the internet. Two midi files are included with the source code as well.
4. The user needs to have OpenGL capable graphics

Open the source files with Processing and run them.

Mouse controls are all button based or slider based. There are no hidden mouse interactable areas.

Non-mouse controls:
	Authoring screen:
		Left and Right arrow keys are used to select beat maps.
		You cannot use the arrow keys while the text entry field is 		the current focus.
	Customization screen:
		Up and Down arrow keys scroll the beat map image unless the 		midi file is playing.
	Play Mode:
		The buttons for each location are displayed on the bottom of 		the screen. In case it is not obvious, the far right button 		(if there are 12 locations) is the semi-colon button (";").
		Pressing "p" will pause the song. To resume you need to go 		through the menu button and click resume.
